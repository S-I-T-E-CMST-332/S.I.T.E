# S.I.T.E
Speech Impediment Training Excersises
This project was assigned as the final project for CMST 332 to all 5 contributors.  The goal was to create a web application the Department of Speech Pathology at Kansas State University could use to log the progress their clients' progress in overcoming their speech impediment (specifically, the letter "r"). A session would consist of a clinician showing a picture to the client, and submitting if the client can correctly pronounce the word. The clients are all under the age of 10.

# Supervisors
The professors within the Department of Speech Pathology are assumed to have a supervisory role. When communicating with the client, they described that the professors would not be hosting the sessions, but rather their students would. The Supervisor role is in charge of creating clinicians within the application, so that the real-life clinicians may log in for their sessions. They may also add pictures to any of the 21 forms of "r" impediments.

# Clinicians
The clinicians are in charge of logging in and logging the results of their session with their client. They may choose what form of the letter "r" they want to practice. From their list of clients, they can view the details of their previous sessions, and track the progress their client is making.
